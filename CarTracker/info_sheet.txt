Automated test suite:
Main.java --> if you compile and run Main.java, you will run my test suite.






Does your program run without error?:
Yes.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
I've tested the program, both with automated tests, and on the command line directly.
It functions as expected.






Additional comments to the grader:
To run the program please take the following steps:
1.  Compile with:   javac CarTracker.java
2.  Run with:       java CarTracker
3.  Enjoy =)
4.  But seriously, since grading is a pain, you can also use my tests to help validate.
    They're in Main.java. Including only in case they would be helpful.


Thank you sincerely for your time,
Tony
