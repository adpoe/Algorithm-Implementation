Name:   Anthony Poerio (Tony)

Lecture section: Monday/Wednesday @9:30am

Recitation day and time: Friday @3:00pm

Assignment #:  1 (one)

Program due date: February 11, 2016

Handed in date:  February 11, 2016

Source code file name(s):
DLBNode.java
DLBTrie.java
pw_check.java



Other file name(s) (if relevant):
dictionary.txt MUST be in same directory as pw_check.class,
when called at runtime.






Does your program run without error?:
No.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
- My program does NOT always return the proper alternative passwords.
Some are invalid, mostly when entering in all-letter passwords.
- I'm unsure of whether my final output in good_passwords.txt is 100%
correct, because I heard at recitation that the file should be about
170MB, and mine is 150MB. Beyond that, I think the logic is sound and
output should be okay.
- My activity monitor shows RAM usage for Java at about 1GB.
- My generation algorithm takes about 1.5 to 2mins, depending on
which computer I run it on.






Additional comments to the grader:
- To compile and run, please:
    1.  Ensure dictionary.txt is in same folder
    2.  Compile:  javac DLBTrie.java
                  javac DLBNode.java
                  javac pw_check.java
    3.  Run:   javac pw_check -g
                - This generates "good_passwords.txt" & "my_dictionary.txt"
    4.  Run:  javac pw_check
                - This will load our data into a DLB Trie, and allow
                the user to check validity of passwords until
                a match is found.
