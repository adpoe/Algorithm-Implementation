Assignment #: 5 - Generating RSA Keypairs

Program due date:  Apr 24, 2016

Handed in date:  Apr 18 2016

Source code file name(s):
    MySign.java
    MyKeyGen.java
    HashExVerify.java
    HashEx.java


Other file name(s) (if relevant):
    I've also included a file named "rsa.txt".
    This is the file I was using to test the program with. 
    I'm sure you'll use your own, but including it only because it's
    what I was using personally.


Does your program run without error?:
    Yes. This program does run without error.

    I have confirmed that:
    - Program correctly identifies when files match
    - Program correctly identifies when a file has been tampered with, 
    after it was signed.

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
    All parts run correctly, according to my testing.



Additional comments to the grader:
    Thank you sincerely for your time.
