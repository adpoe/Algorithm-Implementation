# Algorithms Projects
Programs written for Algorithm Implementation at the University of Pittsburgh.

Some are hacky. Most were written on very little sleep. But.. they work.

Programs are all written in Java, and they are:
- Checking for unique passwords in a De La Briandais Trie
- LZW Compression
- A Tracking System for Car Attributes with an IndexMinPQ
- Graph Algorithms to solve various problems for airport flights
- RSA Signature Implementation
